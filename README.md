# Jade-Weather
This project was created for the exam of Intelligent Agents of the Master's Degree course at the University of Turin.

The project is an example of the `ContractNet` protocol for requesting the weather forecast in a chosen city through [WeatherStack](https://weatherstack.com/) and [WeatherApi](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

## Setup

- Using IntelliJ:
  - Create a new run/debug configuration using the template `application` setting `jade.Boot` as main class
  - Set `Program Arguments` to `-gui -agents "weatherApi:WeatherAgent(0);weatherStack:WeatherAgent(1);asker:AskerAgent(weatherApi, weatherStack)"`
